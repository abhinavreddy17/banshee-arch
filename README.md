This project is based on paper below.

Banshee architecture: Banshee's DRAM cache is set-associative. In this architecture we assume both the in-package and off-package DRAM has the same memory controller and few changes were made to the state-of-art DRAM cache design.

Integrating DRAM within the same package as a processor results in a substantial increase in memory bandwidth, exceeding that of traditional off-package DRAM by several times.
We propose to follow the paper with a novel DRAM cache design named "Banshee" that aims to enhance both in-package and off-package DRAM bandwidth efficiency while maintaining low access latency. With this project we aim to understand new architecture for Large memory bandwidth models.
